# Jeopardy

## The Jeopardy Baord

For this analysis we will often refer to the "rows" on the board.
The board has five rows which we will number one to five.
In the Jeopardy round the dollar values of the five rows are:
$200, $400, $600, $800, and $1000.
In the Jeopardy round the dollar values of the five rows are:
$400, $800, $1200, $1600, and $2000.
The questions get harder as the row numbers increase.

The Jeopardy board has six columns or categories.

A Jeopardy game consists of two rounds, Jeopardy and Double Jeopardy.
The dollar value of the answers is doubled in Double Jeopardy.
The clues are generall harder in Double Jeopardy.


## Correct answers

A correct answer to is made:

* Both rounds: 85%
* Jeopardy round: 88%
* Double Jeopardy round: 82%

So it is true that Double Jeopardy is harder but the difference is not large.


### How much harder to the answer get as you move down the rows?

Here is the percent answered correctly by row:

1. 95%
2. 91%
3. 86%
4. 80%
5. 71%

The questions do get harder as you go down the row.
Row 5 is especially hard, from 80% to 71% correct going from row 4 to row 5.

Here are the percent answered correctly by row and by round, Jeopardy / Double Jeopardy

1. 96% / 95%
2. 93% / 89%
3. 89% / 83%
4. 84% / 76%
5. 76% / 66%

Again confirming that the Double Jeopardy round has harder questions.


### Does question hardness vary by columns?

Not by much, it is probably just statistical noise.
Although the left-hand column is consistently harder than the rest
and the right-hand column is consistently easier than the rest.
The middle four columns are indistinguishable.

### How does the number wrong vary by rows (and columns)?

Add more options to show this.



## Daily Double Analysis

### Are Daily Doubles harder than other clues?

The above figures combine regular clues with Daily Doubles.
In this section we will separate these and compute the percentages separately.

Here is the percent answered correctly for regular clues / daily doubles:

* Both rounds: 86% / 65%
* Jeopardy round: 89% / 67%
* Double Jeopardy round: 83% / 64%

The Daily Double clues are considerably harder than the regular clues.
Note that the percent correct for regular clues is a bit up from the
percentages for all clues in above sections.

These figures are misleading though since they include all five rows.
The rows get harder as you go down and there are more daily doubles
in the lower rows so these results need breaking out.

### Are Daily Doubles harder than other clues by row?

Here are the percent answered correctly by row, regular clues / Daily Doubles (both rounds):

1. 96% / 56%
2. 92% / 73%
3. 87% / 68%
4. 82% / 64%
5. 72% / 60%

So the daily doubles in each row are considerably harder than the regular clues in that row,
roughly 20% fewer correct answers down the board.
Like the regular clues, the daily doubles also get harder as we go down the board,
with roughly the same drops per row (about 4-5% per row).
The main difference is that, for regular clues, there is a large difference between
rows 4 and 5, with a 10% drop in percent correct (double the drops between other rows).

You can safely ignore the results for row 1 since there are so few data points that
the statistics mean little.
In 31 seasons and almost 5000 games a Daily Double has been in row 1 only 16 times.
Caompare that with over 5000 times in row 4.


## Final Jeopardy

Anyone watching Jeopardy knows that the Final Jeopardy questions can get very hard.
It is not uncommon for all three players to miss the Final Jeopardy question.
Overall players get 49% correct on final jeopardy questions.
As we saw above, 85% of the clues in the game are answered correctly.
Even the hardest game questions, row 5 Daily Doubles, are answered correctly 60% of the time.



## Variations over the years

### Daily Double Analytics

#### Where are the daily doubles?

Anyone who watches Jeopardy for a while notices that daily doubles rarely occur in the first row.
It is even unusual to find them in the second row.
The third and fourth rows are where they seem to occur the most.
The sign that a player is "hunting" for a Daily Double is that the player chooses the to start
a column in the third or fourth row.

Here is where the daily doubles are most often found by row:
1. 0%
2. 9%
3. 27%
4. 39%
5. 26%

This is way serious Daily Double hunters start in the fourth row.
After the fourth row they usually go to the third row since the clues are
easier there than in the fifth row (see the next section).

#### Do daily doubles vary by column?

A little but not by much.

The appearance of Arthur Chu on Jeopardy in 2014 caused a lot of internet comment.
A lot of the commentary was his use of "game theory" to win.
What he had done was to look at web sites and books that discussed best strategies
for Jeopardy, added some of his own, and developed a distictive playing stategy.
The most obvious feature was his tendency to "jump around", that is, not to go
down the board in a category from the easiest to hardest questions but to jump
into the middle of categories and jump between categories.

The main advantage of this strategy is that it increases your chance of finding the Daily Doubles.
Finding a Daily Double is an advantage to the player for several reasons.
First the player can wager a large amount of money (up to as much as the player has) on the clue.
This allows a player to win a lot of money quicky and either catch up to a leading
player or take a commanding lead which discourages the other players.
Second the player does not have to compete with any other players to answer the question.
The player can take the time to think about the answer and answer carefully.
Third the plater deprives the other player from getting the advantages of a Daily Double.
So play who is a ways ahead can find the Daily Doubles and prevent another player from quickly catching up.

Another advantage of jumping around is that it can rattle the other player.
The choosing player knows which category is next but the other players do not whoch gives
the choosing player a slight time advantage.








## Jeopardy Analysis

Articles can analyze Jeopardy from two points of view: playing strategy and clue content.

### Category, Clue and Answer Content

Some articles look at the clues and categories themselves:
how often is there a geography category,
how often is a state the answer to a clue,
how often are English kings mentioned,
etc.

This information is useful for players preparing for the game in that is gives pointers
and what to study and how much time to spend on different topics.

This information is also interesting to viewers.


### Playing Stategies

More common are articles on playing strategies:
how much should you bet on Daily Doubles,
should you "hunt" for Daily Doubles,
what is the best wagering strategy for Final Jeopardy,
etc.

There is pretty much universal agreement that it is advantageous to hunt for Daily Doubles.
The problem is that this strategy is unpopular with viewers.

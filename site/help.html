<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>
    This site allows you to perform simple analyses on the results of almost 5000 games of Jeopardy.
    You can compute from one to four different statistics on the game data at a time.
    These results are shown in a summary table and as a graph.
    If you want you call also see a full table of the statistics broken down by individual
    cell on the 5 rows by 6 categories Jeopary game board.
</p>

<h4>Filtering the data</h4>

<p>
    The <i>options blocks</i> along the top of the window allow you to specify what you want to count.
    Each option block is a separate calculation and all four are shown in the summary table,
    the graph, and the full game board.
</p>
<p>
    Each calculation counts up two numbers, a count and a total.
    The result is presented as a percent, detemined by dividing the count by the total.
    Some of the selections in the option block affect only the count
    and some affect both the count and the total.
    Let's look at what the selections in an option block mean.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        # correct: this affects only the count. It will count clues where the number of
        correct responses matched the value selected.
        Here is the meaning of each value that can be selected.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Do not show: do not show the results of this calulcation in the summary table,
                the graph, or the full board table.
            </li>
            <li>
                Any: add to the count for every clue, no matter if there was a correct response or not.
            </li>
            <li>
                0: count the clue if there was no correct response
            </li>
            <li>
                1: count the clue if there was a correct response
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li># wrong: this affects only the count. It will count clues where the number of
        wrong responses matched the value selected.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Any: add to the count for every clue, no matter how many wrong responses were given.
            </li>
            <li>
                1-3: count the clue if there was one or more wrong responses
            </li>
            <li>
                0: count the clue if there was no wrong responses
            </li>
            <li>
                1: count the clue if there was exactly one wrong response
            </li>
            <li>
                2: count the clue if there was exactly two wrong responses
            </li>
            <li>
                3: count the clue if there was exactly three wrong responses
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Daily doubles: this affects the count and the total. Skip the clue if the daily double
        specification does not match. Otherwise count and total the clue of the other filters match.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Don't care: do not reject any clues.
            </li>
            <li>
                No (exclude): exclude any clues that are daily doubles.
            </li>
            <li>
                Yes (only): only count clues that are daily doubles. Exclude clues that
                are not daily doubles.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Out of order: this affects the count and the total. Skip the clue if the out-of-order
        specification does not match. Otherwise count and total the clue of the other filters match.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Don't care: do not reject any clues.
            </li>
            <li>
                No (exclude): exclude any clues that are out of order.
            </li>
            <li>
                Yes (only): only count clues that are out of order. Exclude clues that
                are not out of order.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Rounds: this affects the count and the total. Skip the clue if the round
        specification does not match. Otherwise count and total the clue of the other filters match.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Don't care: do not reject any clues.
            </li>
            <li>
                Jeopardy: only count clues from the  Jeopardy round.
            </li>
            <li>
                Double Jeopardy: only count clues from the Double Jeopardy round.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        %: this determines the total that is used for the percentage caclulation.
        The count is always the same but the divisor can change.
        <ul>
            <li>
                passed/cell total: the percent is determined by the count and total in the cell.
            </li>
            <li>
                passed/row total: the percent is determined by the count and total in the row.
            </li>
            <li>
                passed/column total: the percent is determined by the count and total in the column.
            </li>
            <li>
                passed/board total: the percent is determined by the count and total in the whole board.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Note that in the summary table the cell total and the row total are always the same,
        and the column total and the board total are always the same.
        In the full board view, with all the rows and columns, the four totals are all different.
    </li>
    <li>
        Counts: for each cell we compute a count and a total. Usually we just display the ratio
        of these two as a percentage but we can show the count and total also.
        <ul>
            <li>
                None: do not show counts or totals.
            </li>
            <li>
                Count only: show the count but not the total.
            </li>
            <li>
                count/total: show the count and the total.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

----- Projects
+ Jeopardy Stats
+ JSON Tables: display of hierarchy, for very large files
+ Visual History
+ Reading app

----- To Do

+ Add list of player to compact form, also adds who answered in rights and wrongs, also add more final jeopardy info

+ add info box which tells how many seasons, games, rounds, clues, players found and most recent update
+ add ability to show specified players
+ use the single round games
+ when the final jeopardy results are hidden redo the graph
+ remember the four options setting in localStorage
+ Add "wait for data to load" message
+ add ability to see a single season

+ Add a list of common questions, you can pick one and it will set all the SELECTs
  to the right values, useful for learning how they work.
+ Bug? when I change the '%' select it changes the summary table but not the chart, why not?
+ clean up web site, move everything I don't use to an "old" directory which is not git'ed.
  Also clean up the server side, get rid of old files. Look through them and then
  let rsync -d get rid of the unused things.
+ put website up on dreamhost, github and google and compare them.
+ add "examples" to help which have a button which runs them

+ add mode to show a single game in the matrix
+ maybe add a log div which shows each calcuation you have made, with easy select and copy, and a clear button

% r b -- to create a new version after editing
% r watch-js -- start a watcher to recreate a new version every time a file is saved.
- added some useful scripts, make replacement
% r wc -- line counts for web site
% r wc2 -- line counts for node.js site

----- webpack: wait for later

----- To Do
+ Bug? when I change the '%' select it changes the summary table but not the chart, why not?
+ add "examples" to help which have a button which runs them
+ add info box which tells how many seasons, games, rounds, clues, players found and most recent update
+ fix up the problems it finds with missing data and HTML files.
+ add ability to see a single season
+ add ability to show by seasons not years
+ add ability to show specified players
+ Add "wait for data to load" message
+ move "counts" option out of boxes, have one that applied to all
+ add SELECTs to set all four slave SELECTs, make it easy to reset things.
+ Add a list of common questions, you can pick one and it will set all the SELECTs
  to the right values, useful for learning how they work.
  
+ clean up web site, move everything I don't use to an "old" directory which is not git'ed.
  Also clean up the server side, get rid of old files. Look through them and then
  let rsync -d get rid of the unused things.
+ put website up on dreamhost, github and google and compare them.

+ move the totals column from the right to the left side in the summary graph
+ add mode to show a single game in the matrix
+ when the final jeopardy results are hidden redo the graph
+ maybe add a log div which shows each calcuation you have made, with easy select and copy, and a clear button
